;; STATUS: In-progress

;; TODO: Support adding a hook to run on each kind of event.
;; TODO: Time the events and alert the user when improvements slow things down.
;; TODO: Set the cbd if needed
;; TODO: Collect the suggested improvements and print them at the end.
;; TODO: Detect redundant include-books
;; TODO: Call the linter
;; TODO: Time each type of event and print a report
;; TODO: Start by making sure we can replay the book (and time it).
;; TODO: Special treatment for any books used to define this tool (will be redundant)
;; TODO: Add the ability to run on many files
;; TODO: Add the ability to suppress slow stuff (like dropping a local event or an include-book and trying the entire file).
