(in-package "ACL2")

;; SETUP:
;;
;; 1. Set the ACL2_ADVICE_SERVER environment variable to the server URL (often
;; ends in '/machine_interface')
;;
;; 2. When using this tool, consider doing (adjust-ld-history t state) so
;; that the advice tool can give advice even when the failing theorem is not
;; the most recent event.

;; TODO: Add filtering of unhelpful recommendations:
;; - (maybe) skip use-lemma when the rule had nothing to do with the goal
;; - skip add-disable-hint when the rule is already disabled (or not present?)
;; - skip add-hyp when cgen can falsify the theorem even with the hyp
;; - skip add-library when already present
;; - skip :hints that are already present or subsumed by ones already present
;; - (maybe) skip :hints that conflict with ones already present (e.g., :induct, enable vs and explicit disable)
;; - avoid anything except add-hyp when cgen can falsify the theorem (can't possibly fix the problem)
;; - (maybe) try to avoid theory-invariant errors/warnings
;; - (maybe) try to help clean up hyps (e.g., replacing a subsumed hyp when add-hyp strengthens one, maybe using tau)
;; - avoid both add-enable-hint and use-lemma of the same rule
;; - what else?

;; TODO: Maybe add a time limit for trying recommendations and keep trying more and
;; more until that limit is reached.

;; TODO: Group recommendations that need the same supporting book to be
;; included, to avoid re-including the same book later.

;; TODO: Incorporate cgen to try to see if the theorem is valid or not.  If not
;; valid, only add-hyp can help.

;; TODO: Why does getting advice take ~3 seconds?

;; TODO: Allow doing :rec <n> to try recommendation <n>

;; TODO: Consider trying the advice on the checkpoint(s), not just the goal.

;; TODO: Print times to try the recs.  Keep track of which gives the quickest proof.

;; TODO: Turn off redef (if not), to avoid prompts when including books with name clashes

;; TODO: Avoid including books that are known to be slow?

;; TODO: Avoid illegal hints, such as adding a :by when there is already a :use, or vice versa

;; TODO: Untranslate before printing (e.g., hyps)?
