WARNING: This directory is probably broken, since function
topics-outside-dir uses "[books]/" in a way that was discontinued in
October 2022.

This directory was used in November, 2014 for converting to xdoc the
remaining legacy documentation strings in the ACL2 community books.
It was modified by Matt Kaufmann, with help from Jared Davis, from the
earlier books/system/doc/tool.tgz (which may disappear at some point),
which was used earlier only to convert ACL2 system documentation to
xdoc (producing books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp).

The present directory was added to the git repo in case others find it
useful, for converting legacy documentation outside the community
books.  To see how it was applied to convert legacy doc strings to
defxdoc forms, see conversion-2014-11-24.tgz, starting with its
README.
